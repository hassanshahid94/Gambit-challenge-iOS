DEMO Video Link: **[Gambit challenge - iOS ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8EQbbn94Q8)**

#### Features:
1. I have chosen **option 2** in order to complete the challenge. 
2. The application accesses the file [live text feed](http://tuftuf.gambitlabs.fi/feed.txt) from the server.
3. Application has the capability of parsing data while presenting in User Interface (UI)
4. Used different scheme of colors to demonstrate data for each format.

#### System Architecture:
This application has been developed on Xcode IDE. Xcode is used for creating native iOS, watchOS, tvOS applications. Xcode does not generate the code for any application. Developer has to design the screens first and then connect the code with the design.

**Views:** (UI View Elements)
1. **Main.storyboard** (where I have the UI Views designed)

**Controllers:** (View Controllers)
1. ViewController (Where I handled everyhting. Load the data from the server and displayed on the UI)

**There are another folders in the app:**
**Helpers:**
1. **Constants** (constants used in the app such as URLs)
2. **Extensions** (useful feature that helps in adding more functionality to an existing Class and written one time to access anywhere)
3. **ServerManager** (API calls)

**Variable Naming Conventions:**

As Swift guidelines state that **"Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase. Everything else is lowerCamelCase."**

### Cocoapods:

Gambit challenge uses a open source 3rd Party Library for better user experience:
